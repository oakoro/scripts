Need plan of action for implementing: 
 
A. All sessions are cleared down and start with last reboot date (will depand on scheduled reboots have been consistantly working AND all sessions are closed)

B. To retain one month of data
Clients not rebooting, sessions not ended & over a week old or there is no clear weekly start & stop datetime: 
start with current week only (move everything else to archive), 

clients rebooting:
archive old data - partition archive table & use Okeâ€™s ClearDown script to copy data into partitioned table  -  truncate & partition primary table - switch month data from archive table's partitions
