Tests required for 6 week BPASessionlog_NonUnicode partitioning (Test with different service tiers)

A. Question: What happens within the application and in session/sessionlog when we stop a session and the session is:
Scenarios:
open but not stopped, 
idling but running, 
in middle of process

B.
Time/DTU to create partition function/schema on avg/Max sized table holding 1 month's data for each client's DTU
Time/DTU to truncate the 6th table and switch partitions between the 6 avg/Max sized tables holding 1 week's data for each client's DTU


C. Partition Right "Sliding Window" testing (Time to switch, query time and costs)
Scenarios:
All partitions in on table
partitions two tables
partitions in three tables
Partitions are in 8 tables (One for each partition - including left/right)

D. Partition Right via table renaming testing (Time to switch, query time and costs)
Partitions are in 8 tables (One for each partition - including active right)
 
E. Query time/DTU to select/insert/update/delete session data with 1 month's avg/maxdata and logid PK is clustered
One Table:
non partitioned
patitioned by week
via partitioned view

Separate tables and partitioned view
6 non partitioned tables

F. Query time/DTU to select select/insert/update/delete session data with 1 month's avg/maxdata and logid PK is non-clustered index and sessionnumber is clustered index
One Table:
non partitioned
patitioned by week
via partitioned view

Separate tables and partitioned view
6 non partitioned tables
